# Epileson
Epileson is a mod that adds an end themed upgrade for Chainmail Armor, Epileson, derived from Epilogue and Gambeson.

The armor provides the same protection value as Chainmail but has armor toughness and reduces velocity based damage.

The mod is designed for Origins, to give something in place of Elytra for Origins such as the Elytrian origin, but can be still be played without Origins.
